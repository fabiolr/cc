      <q>I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; one third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.	</q> -- Bobby Handerson

      <p>The FSM is computer litterate and is commonly expressed invoked in computer codes as:</p>
      <p><code>
          var Him = rand("The FSM","HisNoodlelty","The FSM");<br>
          var Username;<br>
          function FSM(Him, Username) {<br>
    return "May " + Him + "Be with " +  Username;              <br>
}<br>
          var Message = FSM(HisNoodleAppendage, Username);<br>
          
          
          </code> </p>
      <p>I like to quote from <cite>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</cite></p>

      <p><p>So then the man saw Him, the FSM, and screamed:
"there<wbr>is<wbr>no<wbr>way<wbr>you<wbr>are<wbr>ever<wbr>going<wbr>to<wbr>convince<wbr>me"!</p><p>but when he was touched by one of His noodly appendages, he realized the FSM was actually his Creator.</p>
